 Ad Format sample #2.

 This sample is a _Photo Ad_ where the ad content is primarily based on a large photo. These ads are
 suitable to display in streams that have have image rich content and only a small amount of text,
 if any. For example:

 <img style="border:2px dotted black" alt="Preview" src="http://docs.namomedia.com/images/ad-format-sample-2.png">

 You can use this format as a template to build your own Ad Format. See the
 <a href="https://github.com/namomedia/ios-sdk/tree/master/AdFormatSamples" target="_blank">
 the source code</a>.

 @available Namo 1.0 and later.
