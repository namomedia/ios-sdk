/**
 This class facilitates requesting Ads and placing them into a custom stream.

 If you are inserting Ads into a UITableView or UICollectionView, you may want to use a
 UITableViewAdPlacer or UICollectionViewAdPlacer object instead. The internal implementations of
 those objects use an instance this class, but make it easy to insert Ads without needing to
 handle changes in your table row positions.

 Some examples of using this class:

 1) You are building a stream that doesn't use a UITableView or UICollectionView. You can
 use shouldInsertAdAtPosition to determined where you need to insert Ads, and dequeueAdForPosition
 to fetch the ad.

 2) You are using a UITableView or UICollectionView but don't want to use
 NAMOTableViewAdPlacer or NAMOCollectionViewAdPlacer.

 3) You have an array of content data that you are showing in your stream, and you want to insert
 an Ad into the content itself. You can call dequeueAdForPosition for each position where you want
 to show an Ad.

/**
 Registers a native Namo Ad format class for this placer.

 Registering an Ad format allows this placer to create an Ad with the given format. You must
 register a format before you request Ads. The format class must conform to the NAMOAdFormat
 protocol.

 You can optionally use the pre-configured NAMOAdFormat classes
 provided by Namo if you want the default Ad formats to show up instead of making your own custom
 ones. For example:

  `[self.adPlacer registerAdFormat:NAMOAdFormatSample1.class];`

 If you register multiple formats, the SDK will choose which format to use for a given ad by
 dynamically determining how well the ad's image and text match the image and label sizes of your
 format. To extend your ability to show different types of ads, you should consider registering at
 least 2 formats, including a format with a large photo and short text, as well as a format with a
 thumbnail image and longer text. See NAMOAdFormatSample1 and NAMOAdFormatSample2 for examples.

 <li>Put your device into 'test' mode.</li>
 <li>Check your device logs. The logs will tell you if you did something obvious, like failing
 to set an application key or not registering an ad format.</li>
