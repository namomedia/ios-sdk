 A category to help bind UIImageViews to and ad image, providing server side image scaling, a
 lightweight caching framework, and appropriate network throttling.

 The image requests generated from using this category use the popular SDWebImageCache library
 internally. The requests also generate image URLs that allow the Namo Media server to scale the
 image to the exact dimensions needed in order to reduce network bandwidth.
