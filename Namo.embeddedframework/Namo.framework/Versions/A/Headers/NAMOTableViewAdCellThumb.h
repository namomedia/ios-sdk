/**
 A table view cell for displaying a thumbnail ad format.

 A _Thumbnail Ad_ is an ad that shows a small to medium sized thumbnail photo along with text
 describing the the ad information. These ads are suitable to display in streams with similar
 content. For example, many news streams display a small picture and a text preview of an article.

 You can use this thumbnail cell as a template to build your own ad cell. You can either build your
 cell as a nib with matching UIView outlets for this cell, or you can copy this cell implementation
 and create your own cell.
